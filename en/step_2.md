## Classify the dinosaurs

Here are some facts about two different dinosaurs:

(mya = million years ago)

| Name       | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |


Each dinosaur has a **category** which describes a group of dinosaurs with similar characteristics. 

You could separate this data into the two types of dinosaur by asking the question

__"Did it live in Europe?"__

If the answer is **yes**, the dinosaur must be a Theropod, and if it is **no** then it must be a Sauropod.
