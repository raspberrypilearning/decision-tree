A machine learning model that uses a decision tree must repeatedly refine its criteria. The more data input, the more accurate it becomes â€” this is called **training**. You have only used a few criteria, but a machine learning model might use many **thousands** of values. 

Here is a larger set of data about dinosaurs: 

(mya = million years ago)

| Name             | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category       |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Allosaurus       | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod       |
| Archaeoceratops  | 1.3         | Herbivorous | Asia           | 121          | Ceratopsian    |
| Bambiraptor      | 1           | Carnivorous | North America  | 84           | Theropod       |
| Brachiosaurus    | 30          | Herbivorous | North America  | 155          | Sauropod       |
| Chindesaurus     | 4           | Carnivorous | North America  | 227          | Early dinosaur |
| Concavenator     | 6           | Carnivorous | Europe         | 130          | Theropod       |
| Diplodocus       | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod       |
| Herrerasaurus    | 3           | Carnivorous | South America  | 228          | Early dinosaur |
| Maiasaura        | 9           | Herbivorous | North America  | 80           | Ornithopod     |
| Parksosaurus     | 3           | Herbivorous | North America  | 76           | Ornithopod     |
| Zephyrosaurus    | 1.8         | Herbivorous | North America  | 120          | Ornithopod     |

Why not download and print these [dinosaur cards](resources/dinosaur_cards.pdf){:target="_blank"} and use them to help you draw the decision tree?
</p>

--- task ---

Draw a decision tree that allows you to correctly identify each <span style="color: #0faeb0">**category**</span> of dinosaur. 

**Tip:** Each question should split the data so that one category of dinosaur is fully identified.

[Choose another dinosaur](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/dino-directory.html){:target="_blank"} and use your decision tree to identify which category it is in. Was your decision tree correct?

Here is one possible solution, but there are many valid trees you could draw:
