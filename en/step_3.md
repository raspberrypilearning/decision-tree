## More dinosaurs


Let's add the data for another dinosaur. 

| Name       | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Bambiraptor| 1           | Carnivorous | North America  | 84           | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |

+ Is it still possible for you to split the dinosaurs into categories using the same question you chose before?

For example, the question

__"Did it live in Europe?"__

...is no longer helpful, because the Bambiraptor is a Theropod, but it did not live in Europe, so this question cannot separate the two categories.
