Let's add the data for another dinosaur. 

| Name         | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus   | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Concavenator | 6           | Carnivorous | Europe         | 130          | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus   | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |


The question __"Was it longer than 6 metres?"__ no longer helps you to separate the dinosaurs into the two categories, because the Allosaurus is a Theropod, but it was 12m long.
