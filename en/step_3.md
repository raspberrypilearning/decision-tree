Let's add the data for another dinosaur. 

| Name         | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus   | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Concavenator | 6           | Carnivorous | Europe         | 130          | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus   | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |


The question

__"Was it longer than 6 metres?"__

does not now allow us to separate the dinosaurs into two categories, because the Allosaurus is a Theropod, but it was 12m long.
