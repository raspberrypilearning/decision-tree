Let's add another dinosaur:

| Name         | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus   | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Concavenator | 6           | Carnivorous | Europe         | 130          | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus   | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |
| Herrerasaurus| 3           | Carnivorous | South America  | 228          | Early dinosaur |

Is it still possible for you to split the dinosaurs into categories using the question __"Did it live more than 130 million years ago?"__?

No, because there are now three dinosaurs that lived more than 130 million years ago, but they are in different categories. 

Even if you changed the criteria to **more than 152 million years ago**, you still can't separate them into three categories.

To put dinosaurs in three categories, you need to add another question. 

--- task ---

Choose a **different** piece of data from the table; for example, length or diet.

What question could you write using this data in the blank space to correctly categorise the remaining dinosaurs?

Any of the following questions would give the correct category for every dinosaur:

- Was it shorter than 26 metres?
- Was it a carnivore?
- Did it live in Europe?
