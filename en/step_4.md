## Decision tree

--- challenge ---

A machine learning model which uses a decision tree must repeatedly refine its criteria. The more data it sees, the more accurate it becomes. 

Here is a larger set of data about dinosaurs: 

(mya = million years ago)

| Name             | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category       |
