## Use more than one split

Now we have added another new dinosaur, **Herrerasaurus**:

| Name         | Length (m)  | Diet        | Continent      | Lived (mya)  | Category  |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Allosaurus   | 12          | Carnivorous | Europe         | 152          | Theropod  |
| Concavenator | 6           | Carnivorous | Europe         | 130          | Theropod  |
| Diplodocus   | 26          | Herbivorous | North America  | 152          | Sauropod  |
| Herrerasaurus| 3           | Carnivorous | South America  | 228          | Early dinosaur |

+ Is it still possible for you to split the dinosaurs into categories using the question 

__"Did it live more than 130 million years ago?"__

No, because there are now three dinosaurs which lived more than 130 million years ago, but they are in different categories. 

Even if you changed the criteria to **more than 151 million years ago**, you still can't separate into three categories.

To put dinosaurs in three categories, you need to add another question.

+ Choose a different piece of data from the table, and think of a question about it you could add in the blank space:

![A decision tree with the first question 'Did it live more than 130 million years ago?' with yes = Early dinosaur and No = a blank space for a question](images/decision2.png)
